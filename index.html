    <!--
      Planning:
      Search for the city, provide all options in a list close to the search.
      Allow the user to select the most appropriate selection.
      Once selected, the location is added to a master list, and the weather for that location is loaded.
      Selecting other locations in the list will load the weather for that location.
      Any locations added to the master list will also have a time stamp. if more than 4(?) hours have passed
      another API call will go out and the data will be refreshed.
      I also want to give the user the option to trigger a data refresh.
      The refresh trigger will appear in the weather display.
      At mobile, clicking the location, or adding a new location will scroll the user to the weather display.
